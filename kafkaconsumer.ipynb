I've made a few friends in the class and a lot of the classmates kind of know each other and are in this friend group. Its taken a while for all of us to get to know each other. As of recently, I've started developing some feelings for one of the women in the friend group, which I didn't expect at first, but as I've gotten to know her better, I realised that I like her. One of the friends in the group invited all of us to a party and when I saw she was there I got excited and we spent almost the whole party talking. There were a few other people around us but as time went on it was just us talking in the corner of the loud livingroom. We talked about all kinds of stuff, told her some stuff about me and she did the same. I learned she's a year older than me, she lives in an area I'm familiar with, where she works, what kind of movies and games she likes and I don't think she's seeing anyone.\\n\\nEven if she's not interested in me, she's also just super cool and fun to be around, and I like being her friend. I'm just starting to worry now. I don't want to be creepy, or come on too strong. She might not like me back and I don't want her feeling uncomfortable around me. I talked to her at the party and was fairly confident in doing so then, but that was a social event and we were drinking a bit. (I'm Canadian, 19 is legal) Ever since, it's been difficult for me to approach her to chat during off moments after classes or while we're in the hall, times where we could, even just to be friendly. Because the course is ending soon I've also wanted to get her number or add her on discord, along with other friends in the group, but I'm too scared to do that as well.\\n\\nI'm just worried about being rude or making her feel uncomfortable. I don't want to ask to exchange numbers or to hang out because I'm not sure if we're even friends yet, we might just be classmates who know each other. I'm kind of worried I just took all her time up at that party and she wanted to do other stuff. I was wondering if anyone could give any advice on this situation I'm in?

I utilize a wheelchair and have a lot of medical equipment. I was assigned a roommate (19m) and have been living with him in a double in campus housing for the past few months.

He also makes fun of me for being in a wheelchair and mocks me and my pain. He thinks I exaggerate my pain to get out of doing things.\\n\\nHe is so dense. I started yelling at him in and told him I would do anything to trade places with him and he wouldn’t last a week being a guy in a wheelchair. I explained i need medical equipment and it needs to be in the room (I wish I didn’t it is very expensive and yes takes up space), i don’t even get many friends and a GF like he can easily bc it is very hard for me to make friends and be social bc of accessibility and I would be extremely fortunate to have a GF EVER, how I still have to put in all the work just on my own time when he isn’t here and actually have to reach out to people for help (bc I wasn’t in class for the instructions), how the bus is needed for me to move around campus and that I am not “lazy”, and how I get to work from home bc it is hard for me to commute into an office (and that unlike him I don’t have the luxury of my parents paying for my college). I told him he is an ableist asshole and a jerk and that he wouldn’t last a week being a guy in a wheelchair. But now I feel bad and think I went overboard.
